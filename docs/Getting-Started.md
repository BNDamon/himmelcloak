# Getting Started

The working core currently covers OIDC discovery, password direct grant, ID-token verification,
refresh, revocation, and userinfo. The native flow driver and additional factors are in progress.

## Run the real Keycloak suite

Docker with the Compose v2 plugin and the OpenSSL command-line tool is the
simplest supported development environment:

```sh
make test-live
make oracle-down
```

This builds a test image with the pinned Rust toolchain, the pinned wolfSSL stable release, and the
`curl` crate linked to a wolfSSL-backed libcurl. It generates a local test CA, starts stock
Keycloak with the seeded realm, and runs real HTTPS login tests.
`KEYCLOAK_IMAGE=quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:nightly make test-live` selects the nightly server. CI
resolves the latest stable Keycloak release and the nightly image to exact image digests at run
time. Stable login is required for merging; nightly failures remain visible in an optional
check without cancelling stable. See [CI gates and runtime baseline](CI.md) for triggers
and branch-rule settings.

On Linux, `make native` builds the same native libraries into `.native`. `make build`, `make test`,
and `make lint` use them. The local build requires Autotools, libtool, pkg-config, clang, and a
Rust toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml`. Plain `cargo test` skips the ignored live tests;
`make test` runs unit tests plus the local integration and contract tests. Use `make test-live` for Keycloak.
The Linux native build links wolfSSL and libcurl statically so locally built
applications can run without setting a library search path. Rebuild a prefix
created by an older shared-library build before using it with this setup.

The test realm's user is `alice` with password `correct-horse-battery-staple`. These credentials
are for the disposable Docker realm only.

See [Testing](Testing.md) for the fixture and CI contract.
